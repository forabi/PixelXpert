**If you're updating from previous versions:**  
Update your module via module update shortcut in Magisk, or use the built-in updater located in the app  
  
**To install, you will need to:**  
Install LSPosed  
Caution: If using KSU, make sure to disable "unmount modules by default" from KSU options, or your device will bootloop  
Install the zip file in Magisk/KSU (You will be able to install canary builds once the stable version is installed, through built-in updater)  
Reboot  
Technically, the module should automatically activate itself in Lsposed and get its required root permissions. If didn't, please activate manually and reboot again
